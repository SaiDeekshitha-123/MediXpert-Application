## 📖 About

Manual diagnosis of medical images can be time-consuming, error-prone, and limited by the availability of skilled radiologists. MediXpert provides an end-to-end automated solution using AI to classify and detect three major conditions:

- Brain Tumors (MRI)
- Pneumonia (Chest X-ray)
- Bone Fractures (X-ray)

This platform integrates deep learning models with a simple web interface built in Flask.
