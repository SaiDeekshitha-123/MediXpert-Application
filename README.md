# üß† MediXpert Application

**MediXpert** is an AI-powered Flask web application designed to detect **brain tumors**, **pneumonia**, and **bone fractures** from medical images (MRI/X-rays) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It aims to support medical professionals with rapid, reliable, and automated image-based diagnostics‚Äîespecially in regions with limited access to radiological expertise.

## üìñ About

Manual diagnosis of medical images can be time-consuming, error-prone, and limited by the availability of skilled radiologists. MediXpert provides an end-to-end automated solution using AI to classify and detect three major conditions:

- Brain Tumors (MRI)
- Pneumonia (Chest X-ray)
- Bone Fractures (X-ray)

This platform integrates deep learning models with a simple web interface built in Flask.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

1. User uploads image via web interface.
2. Flask server processes the image.
3. CNN model predicts condition.
4. Result displayed with confidence.
5. Report is optionally generated.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medixpert.git
cd medixpert

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Start the Flask server using `python app.py`.
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Upload a medical image (MRI or X-ray) using the web form.
4. Select the medical condition: **Brain Tumor**, **Pneumonia**, or **Bone Fracture**.
5. View the predicted result and confidence level.
6. Optionally, download the generated PDF report for further analysis or record-keeping.

## üß™ Example Code (`app.py`)

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import tensorflow as tf
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load CNN models
models = {
    "brain": tf.keras.models.load_model("models/brain_model.h5"),
    "pneumonia": tf.keras.models.load_model("models/pneumonia_model.h5"),
    "fracture": tf.keras.models.load_model("models/fracture_model.h5")
}

def preprocess_image(img):
    img = img.resize((150, 150))
    img = np.array(img) / 255.0
    return np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
    if request.method == "POST":
        img_file = request.files["image"]
        condition = request.form["condition"]

        if img_file and condition in models:
            img = Image.open(img_file.stream)
            processed = preprocess_image(img)
            prediction = models[condition].predict(processed)[0][0]
            result = "Affected" if prediction > 0.5 else "Healthy"
            confidence = round(prediction * 100, 2) if result == "Affected" else round((1 - prediction) * 100, 2)
            return render_template("result.html", result=result, confidence=confidence)

    return render_template("index.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
## üß© Modules

### 1. **Image Upload & Preprocessing**
- Accepts medical images in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.dcm` format.
- Validates file type and size.
- Resizes images to 150x150 pixels for model compatibility.
- Normalizes pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
- Converts images to NumPy arrays for model input.

### 2. **CNN-Based Detection**
- Loads pre-trained CNN models for each condition:
  - **Brain Tumor**
  - **Pneumonia**
  - **Bone Fracture**
- Ensures model is only loaded once for performance.
- Makes predictions and outputs a probability score.

### 3. **Result Interpretation**
- Converts raw prediction scores into readable results:
  - e.g., "Healthy" or "Affected"
- Displays a confidence percentage.
- Customizes output messaging based on the condition.
- Offers basic guidance or recommendations.

### 4. **Report Generation**
- Dynamically generates PDF reports.
- Includes:
  - Predicted diagnosis
  - Confidence score
  - Placeholder for doctor‚Äôs comments
- Supports clean, branded layout for professional use.

### 5. **User Interface (UI) Module**
- Provides a responsive and accessible web interface.
- Features:
  - Dashboard for viewing history
  - Image upload with preview
  - Results display in a clean layout
- Supports keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## üìä Results

The MediXpert models were tested using benchmark datasets with strong performance:

| Medical Condition | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Brain Tumor       | 96.3%    |
| Pneumonia         | 93.5%    |
| Bone Fracture     | 91.2%    |

### Evaluation Metrics Used:
- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness
- **Precision**: Positive prediction quality
- **Recall**: Ability to detect all positive cases
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analysis of TP, TN, FP, FN
- **ROC Curve & AUC**: Discrimination capability
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Focus on imbalanced datasets

Visual tools like bar plots, confusion matrix heatmaps, and ROC curves were used to analyze performance.
